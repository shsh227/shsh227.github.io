### Description:  My final coding project is a globally accessible webpage that displays the most current good news to the viewer. To get it working, I had to code several different files. First of all, there is scrape_news.py. This is a python script that on top imports all necessary libraries such as e.g. selenium. It then adds some chrome options so that the chrome driver can be directed to a website called goodnews.eu. For that, I have also downloaded chromedriver.exe into my project folder. The website called goodnews dynamically uploads good news every few days. My script scans those articles (either the top one or the older ones beneath) and extracts the publication date, title, summary and image url of all articles published in the current week. Those are then stored in a database which I created on top of the file. Next, there is app.py. This script specifically uses Flask to pass the latest 15 articles stored in the database into index.html. My index.html file which is stored in a templates folder consists of a head and a body. The head connects to a CSS file, sets the title and assures that the webpage looks also aesthetic on smaller screens. Additionally, it uses some JavaScript so that only one article is displayed at a time â€“ sliding through the different news like an advertisement slideshow. In addition to that, some configurations define that a fullscreen button can be seen and clicked. The screen is then converted to full screen and an exit fullscreen button takes its place, reverting the changes when clicked. The body of the script contains all elements of the website: First, the headline with a blue background color, the (exit) fullscreen button and a logo of the original goodnews website (accessed via the image, that I have downloaded into a static folder). Then, for each article that was passed to the file the image, title, summary and date. Lastly, there is a footer with the same background as the heading, referencing goodnews and their website. Besides the logo picture, in my static folder is also the CSS file that sets the aesthetics. For the buttons, logo, footer and much more, it defines the color and position as well as the distance to other elements. The article information are arranged in a box and it took some fine definitions to have it centered in the right way without too much space. At the bottom of the CSS, some configurations are overwritten with adjustments in case the screen is too small to fit the default mode. Lastly, I have a python file called generate_index.py.  The github website is not ably to load the content dynamically, so this file generates a static html that is then the basis for the webpage.
