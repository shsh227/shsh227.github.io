                        <p class = "summary">This week brought strikingly different stories of conservation in action: global leaders in Zimbabwe pledged stronger protection for wetlands, Italy introduced tough new fines for littering, and a Viennese cemetery revealed its role as a quiet refuge for foxes, deer, and field hamsters. Together, they show how nature can be safeguarded on every scale — from international agreements to the hidden corners of a city.</p>

                        <p class = "summary">A simple trick can turn wasps from picnic pests into peaceful guests. By offering wasps a small portion of the food they take—placed a short distance from your own—you can keep them occupied and away from your plate. Early in summer, they prefer protein to feed larvae; later, they seek sugar as the colony winds down.</p>
